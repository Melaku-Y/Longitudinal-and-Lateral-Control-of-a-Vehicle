Project Title: Combined Longitudinal and Lateral Control of a Vehicle

Instructions to Simulate the Project:

1. Ensure that YALMIP is installed and added to your MATLAB working path.
   - If YALMIP is not installed, download it from [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) and follow the installation instructions.

2. Open MATLAB and run the script:
   Main_Script.m
3. In Simulink, open the model:
   Main.slx
4. You can modify parameters such as speed or road conditions in the "Speed and Road Information" block within the Simulink model.

5. Run the Simulink model to simulate the system. 
   - Results will be displayed in the Scopes for visualization.

6. To visualize the trajectory tracking in MATLAB, run the script:
   Main_Script.m
   again after the simulation.

Note: All simulation results, including speed tracking, yaw rate tracking, and trajectory following, are automatically displayed in the provided scopes and MATLAB plots.
